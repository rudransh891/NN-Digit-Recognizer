## Digit Recognizer using Neural Network

This project is basically meant for learning about Neural Networks and implementing one from scratch, no crutches. Here I implement them manually in C++ so that I am forced to learn about a neural networks intricacies that I might miss by only doing theory or directly jumping to libraries like PyTorch or Scikit Learn.
This project also poses a challenge on me, to make a working project in C++ which will likely force me to learn other important parts of develeoping any software in general.
