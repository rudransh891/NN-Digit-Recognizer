## Digit Recognizer using Neural Network

-This project is basically meant for learning about Neural Networks and implementing one from scratch, no crutches. 
-This is so that I am forces to learn about the intricasies of a neural network, and also ensure I understand the math behind it.
-This project also poses a challenge on me, to make a working project in C++ which will likely force me to learn other important parts of development any software in general.
